# Project Title: Wiki Content Management System
# Project Overview:

Wiki requires an efficient content management system coupled with a user-friendly front-end to provide an exceptional user experience. The system aims to enable administrators to easily manage categories, tags, and wikis, while granting authors the ability to create, edit, and delete their content. The front-end prioritizes a streamlined user interface with features such as simplified registration, an effective search bar, and dynamic displays of the latest wikis and categories for navigation.
Key Features:
Back Office:

    Category Management:
        Administrators can create, edit, and delete categories to organize content.

    Tag Management:
        Administrators can create, edit, and delete tags for improved content search and grouping.
        Tags can be associated with wikis for precise navigation.

        A search bar is available for visitors to search wikis, categories, and tags without page refreshing (utilizing AJAX).

        The homepage or a dedicated section displays the latest wikis added to the platform for quick access to recent content.

    Latest Categories Display:
        A separate section showcases the latest created or updated categories, allowing users to quickly discover recent themes added to the platform.

    Single Wiki Page Redirection:
        Clicking on a wiki redirects users to a unique page dedicated to that wiki, offering comprehensive details such as content, associated categories, tags, and author information.
